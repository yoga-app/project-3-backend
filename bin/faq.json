      "question": "Can I practice yoga if Iâ€™m not flexible?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We do not practice yoga because we are flexible, we are flexible because we practice yoga. It takes time and lots of practice to release tight muscles, and even if you are stiff as a stick, each yoga pose can be modified to suit your individual body needs. And we can always use pops to help get into the shapes of each pose. \nFlexibility should be a long-term goal, not a barrier to hold you back from the benefits of yoga!\n",
